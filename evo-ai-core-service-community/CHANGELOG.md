## [Unreleased]

## [v1.0.0-rc5] - 2026-05-27

## [v1.0.0-rc4] - 2026-05-25

## [v1.0.0-rc3] - 2026-05-17

Integration release — adds the `pkg/evoextensions` contract (no-op extension points for the future Enterprise edition), exposes a proxy to list Knowledge Spaces from Nexus from within the agent builder, and standardizes docs/branding for Evolution Foundation 2026.

### Added

- **`pkg/evoextensions`** — three no-op interfaces published as an extension point (EVO-1285). The contract is versioned in `EXTENSION_POINTS.md` and allows the Enterprise edition to inject implementations without forking.
- **Knowledge Nexus — spaces listing proxy** in `/agent-integrations`. Backend endpoint that queries the Nexus API and returns the list of available spaces, consumed by the Knowledge Nexus selector in the frontend Agent Builder.

### Changed

- **Docs** standardized for Evolution Foundation 2026 (README, LICENSE, NOTICE, TRADEMARKS).
- **Docs (org)** — GitHub URLs updated from `EvolutionAPI` to `evolution-foundation`.

### Fixed

## [v1.0.0-rc2] - 2026-05-05
