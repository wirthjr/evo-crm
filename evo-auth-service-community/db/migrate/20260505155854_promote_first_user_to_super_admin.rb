# Introduce the `super_admin` role and promote the bootstrap user of
# existing installations to it.
#
# Context: prior to this release, the user created via the setup wizard
# was assigned the `account_owner` role, which used to also include the
# installation_configs.manage permission. With this release that
# permission moves to a dedicated `super_admin` role, so the operator of
# every existing installation needs to be promoted to keep their access
# to /settings/admin (Email/Storage/SocialLogin/OpenAI/Channels/Inbound
# Email/Frontend Runtime).
#
# Why this lives in a migration instead of the rbac seed: production
# deploys do NOT run `bin/rails db:seed`. Seeds only run on first install
# via SetupBootstrapService#run_seeds. Migrations, on the other hand, run
# on every deploy via `bin/rails db:migrate`. So creating the role and
# promoting the user from a migration is the only path that reaches
# already-bootstrapped production installations without manual steps.
#
# The "first user" heuristic (oldest created_at) is reliable on the
# Community edition because the install flow only creates a single user
# in the wizard step (advisory lock + User.count > 0 check in
# SetupBootstrapService).
#
# Idempotent: re-runnable without side effects. Fresh installs that run
# the rbac seed afterwards skip the create_or_find here as the role
# already exists; the seed's `find_or_initialize_by` then operates on the
# existing record and the permission set converges.

    # Ordering caveat: this migration references `users`, `roles`, and
    # `user_roles`, which are created by init_schema (timestamp 9025…) on
    # fresh installs. Because of that far-future timestamp, init_schema
    # actually runs AFTER this migration on a fresh install — so we
    # short-circuit cleanly and let the bootstrap step (which assigns
    # super_admin directly via the seed) handle the fresh case.
