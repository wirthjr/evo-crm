## [v1.0.0-rc5] - 2026-05-27

Hardening release for fresh-install scenarios. Three critical fixes from the multimport incident (2026-05-27) make EvoAuth survive cold starts where multiple services race against the shared database and the licensing server is unreachable. The auth-service no longer 500s when a sibling service has pre-created a stub `users` table, no longer blocks any request behind a licensing gate, and now actually processes its licensing Sidekiq queue so `SetupJob` / `HeartbeatJob` complete instead of being silently parked. Also ships AuthBridge 1.1.0 (extension point for Enterprise email lookup + sign-in) and a small batch of migration compatibility fixes.

### Highlights

- **Multimport / cold-start hardening (3 fixes)** — fresh installs that boot alongside other services sharing the same Postgres no longer break authentication. Stub `users(id integer)` tables created by sibling services (e.g. `evo-processor` SQLAlchemy `create_all`) are now detected and dropped before `InitSchema` runs, so the canonical schema (uuid PK, `mfa_method`, `encrypted_password`, `oauth_access_tokens`, …) is created intact. Combined with the SetupGate and Sidekiq queue fixes below, the auth-service boots and serves traffic cleanly in mixed-service environments even when the licensing server is temporarily unreachable.
- **Licensing never blocks a request** — `SetupGate` is downgraded from a hard 503 gate to a pure observability hook. Self-hosted Community installs no longer go down when the licensing server is unreachable — license state becomes telemetry, not an enforcement layer.
- **AuthBridge 1.1.0** — new strict extension points (`find_user_by_email`, `sign_in_request`) for Enterprise builds, contract-versioned via the existing `EXTENSION_POINTS.md` flow.

### Added

- **AuthBridge 1.1.0 — `find_user_by_email` + `sign_in_request`** (`e7c31e5`) — two new strict extension points exposed by `AuthBridge`. `find_user_by_email` lets an Enterprise implementation resolve a user from an alternate identity store (e.g. SSO directory) before the local lookup; `sign_in_request` lets it inject custom logic around request-time sign-in (audit, MFA elevation, just-in-time provisioning). Both follow the existing duck-typed contract with explicit error if the implementation returns an invalid shape. Documented in `EXTENSION_POINTS.md` (consumer-specific examples scrubbed in `1eed63e`).

### Changed

- **Docs — `EXTENSION_POINTS.md` scrub** (`1eed63e`) — removed consumer-specific examples from the AuthBridge 1.1.0 notes so the contract document stays generic and stable across Enterprise consumers.

### Fixed

- **Multimport stub `users` table drop before `InitSchema`** (`a962b3b`) — on fresh installs where another service (typically `evo-processor` via SQLAlchemy `create_all`) wins the race to Postgres, a minimal `users(id integer)` stub is created with the wrong primary-key type and no auth columns. `InitSchema` then silently aliased onto that stub, leaving the database without `oauth_access_tokens`, `mfa_method`, `encrypted_password`, etc. — every authentication path 500'd on `relation "oauth_access_tokens" does not exist`. The migration now detects the stub (integer-PK `users` with no auth columns) and drops it before `InitSchema` runs, so the canonical schema is created intact. Idempotent — does nothing on installations whose `users` table already matches the canonical shape.
- **`SetupGate` is observability, never enforcement** (`221097c`) — the licensing setup gate previously returned `503 SETUP_REQUIRED` on every non-bypass route when license context was inactive. On self-hosted Community this turned any licensing-server outage into a full auth outage. `SetupGate` now (a) attempts to rehydrate license context if inactive, (b) emits the observability signal regardless of the result, and (c) **always forwards the request**. License state becomes telemetry; no request is blocked by it.
- **Sidekiq licensing queue actually processed** (`6219e38`) — `licensing` was missing from `config/sidekiq.yml`, so `SetupJob` and `HeartbeatJob` were enqueued and silently parked forever. Result: `api_key` was never persisted after setup, and heartbeat retries never fired. The queue is now registered and processed alongside the default queues.
- **`add_fk_if_missing` type-aware for legacy integer PKs** (`39c92b3`, #36) — the FK helper now inspects the referenced PK type and matches the column type accordingly, so installations migrating from a historical integer-PK `users` table no longer fail with type-mismatch errors when adding foreign keys.
- **ActiveRecord migration version downgrade for compatibility** (`c725a96`, #37) — migration version downgraded to 7.1 to match the Rails version actually in use, preventing boot errors on `db:migrate` against environments still on 7.1.

### Notes for upgrade

- **Licensing no longer blocks any endpoint.** If your operational runbooks relied on the auth-service returning `503 SETUP_REQUIRED` while licensing was unreachable, update them — that signal is now an observability event, not a request-blocking response. License state still surfaces via logs/metrics for monitoring.
- **Fresh installs in mixed-service environments now boot cleanly** even when multiple services race against the shared Postgres. No action required for new installs.
- **If you are upgrading from an installation broken by the rc4 multimport race** (typical symptom: `relation "oauth_access_tokens" does not exist` on every login attempt; the `users` table exists but its PK is `integer` instead of `uuid` and the auth columns are missing), drop the cached stub `users` table manually before running `db:migrate` on rc5 — the migration's auto-detect handles the common shape, but if your stub diverges you may need to drop it explicitly. Back up first.
- **Sidekiq operators**: the `licensing` queue is now active. Ensure your Sidekiq worker process is started with the default queue list (or explicitly includes `licensing`) so `SetupJob` / `HeartbeatJob` are picked up.
- **AuthBridge consumers (Enterprise)**: extension contract bumped to 1.1.0 — see `EXTENSION_POINTS.md`. 1.0.x consumers continue to work; new hooks are opt-in.

## [v1.0.0-rc4] - 2026-05-25

MFA hardening release focused on plaintext backup-code remediation, plus licensing resilience, onboarding survey delivery, and runtime storage configuration. The post-EVO-991 cleanup forces re-setup for any user whose backup-code array still contains legacy plaintext entries; the licensing service now operates fail-open during outages instead of blocking logins; and Admin UI storage changes (S3/GCS/local) apply at runtime without restart.

### Added

- **EVO-1104 — Onboarding survey push** — implementation of onboarding-survey response push plus resume endpoint. Users that abandoned the flow can pick up where they left off, and submitted answers are forwarded to the collection service.
- **Licensing fail-open** — when the licensing server is unreachable (timeout, DNS, 5xx) the auth-service now operates in a short fail-open window instead of blocking logins. Reduces blast radius of incidents on the licensing server.

### Changed

- **Runtime storage provider** — storage settings (S3, GCS, local) saved via the Admin UI are applied to the running process without restart. A warn log is emitted whenever the service falls back to the default storage provider (EVO-1050).

### Fixed

- **EVO-991 — Plaintext backup codes from pre-fix deployments** — one-shot migration zeroes `otp_backup_codes` and clears `mfa_confirmed_at` for any user whose array still contains non-BCrypt (legacy plaintext) entries. Affected users are flagged with `mfa_setup_incomplete: true` in the user payload, and `auth_controller#login` bypasses the MFA challenge for that state (`mfa_enabled?` returns `false` when `mfa_confirmed_at` is `nil`) until re-setup completes. Specs cover the mixed-legacy array, post-migration empty state, and bypass regression.
- **EVO-1104 — Session cache not invalidated after MFA re-setup** — `complete_mfa_setup` now calls `TokenValidationService.invalidate_cache_for_user` so the session reflects `mfa_setup_incomplete: false` immediately after `verify_totp`, instead of waiting up to 5 minutes for the cache TTL.
- **Double-load guard and production hardening for extension points** — review-blocker fix preventing double-load of `LoginGate` and `TokenClaims` plus extra hardening in production paths.
- **ActiveRecord migration version downgrade 7.2 → 7.1** — migration version downgraded to match the Rails version actually in use. Avoids boot errors when running `db:migrate` against environments still on 7.1.

### Security

- Plaintext backup codes may have been stored on deployments prior to the EVO-991 fix. The migration in this release invalidates those records and forces affected users to re-setup their MFA. If you enabled MFA before v1.0.0-rc4, you will be prompted to set up TOTP again on next login. Recommended as a precaution — not a response to a confirmed leak.

## [v1.0.0-rc3] - 2026-05-17

Stabilization release — focuses on bug fixes in 2FA backup codes (500 + plaintext hash), `account_owner` / `super_admin` boundary on role endpoints (privilege escalation via delegation), runtime application of SMTP/BMS/Resend configs, structured password validation on user creation, and `agent` role RBAC (drop of `pipelines.update`, backfill of `pipelines.read`). Also consolidates the open-core foundation via `EXTENSION_POINTS.md` + strict extension modules (`LoginGate`, `TokenClaims`), adds full role CRUD scoped to `account_owner`, and introduces permissions for `products.*` and `template_bundles`.

### Added

- **EVO-1381 — Extension point modules with LoginGate and TokenClaims** (#31) — strict implementation of extension points for Enterprise: `LoginGate` (hook called before token issuance, allows denying login with a reason), `TokenClaims` (hook that adds custom claims to the JWT). Both with strict contracts via duck-typing + explicit error if the Enterprise implementation returns an invalid shape.
- **EVO-1375 — `EXTENSION_POINTS.md`** (#29) — document declaring the extension points of the auth-service. Versioned contract.
- **EVO-1061 — Full role CRUD scoped to `account_owner`** — `index`/`show`/`create`/`update`/`destroy` endpoints for custom roles, all limited to the account scope of the requesting `account_owner`. Includes permission delegation with privilege escalation guard.
- **EVO-1116 — `template_bundles` resource in RBAC** — `template_bundles.read` / `manage` permissions added via migration backfill, supporting the CRM template export/import feature.
- **`products.*` permissions** — resource added to RBAC with backfill for existing roles (`account_owner` gets `manage`, `agent` gets `read`).
- **`spec/db/seeds/rbac_spec.rb`** — regression guard for the `agent` role permission set (EVO-1060). Detects accidental additions of destructive permissions (e.g., `pipelines.update` would grant access to `archive` / `set_as_default`). Also pins the `account_owner` / `super_admin` boundary to ensure the installation-level config panel does not leak outside `super_admin`.
- **`spec/controllers/roles_controller_spec.rb`** — boundary regression guards between `account_owner` and `super_admin` (EVO-1060), ensuring neither role can escape its scope.

### Changed

- **EVO-1049 — SMTP/BMS/Resend settings applied at runtime** (#24) — previously these settings were read only at container boot, requiring a restart to reflect changes made via the UI. Now they are re-resolved on every operation, allowing the operator to change SMTP/BMS/Resend without downtime.
- **Migration `20260513170000_add_pipelines_read_to_agent_role.rb`** — backfills `pipelines.read` on the `agent` role for already-bootstrapped installations (EVO-1060). PROD runs `db:migrate` and not `db:seed`, so changes to `db/seeds/rbac.rb` that affect an existing role must ship with an idempotent migration — same convention as `20260505155854_promote_first_user_to_super_admin.rb`. Idempotent and reversible.
- **Docs** standardized for Evolution Foundation 2026 (README, LICENSE, NOTICE, TRADEMARKS).
- **Docs (org)** — GitHub URLs updated from `EvolutionAPI` to `evolution-foundation`.

### Fixed

- **2FA backup codes — 500 + plaintext** (EVO-991) — the backup-codes listing endpoint returned 500 (NoMethodError on a nil field) and codes were stored in plaintext in the DB. Fixed with BCrypt hashing + nil-field handling + applied round 3 review feedback.
- **EVO-1063 — Structured 422 password validation** — previously the password validation failure on user creation returned 422 without a machine-readable field; the frontend could not map the error to the correct field. Now the response includes structured codes (`password.too_short`, `password.missing_uppercase`, etc.) consumed by the inline checklist on the frontend (EVO-1063).
- **Migration `add_message_template_permissions_to_account_owner`** — on fresh install it failed with `PG::UndefinedTable: roles` for a particular timestamp ordering; now it falls through silently when the table does not yet exist (`table_exists?(:roles)` guard).
- **EVO-1060 — Agent role: `pipelines.read` granted, `pipelines.update` NOT granted** — fresh installs now expose the `/pipelines` page (and the sidebar entry) to agents. Drag-and-drop between stages was already authorized by `pipelines.read` alone — `pipelines.update` had been added under a wrong assumption and would have silently unlocked destructive endpoints (`archive`, `set_as_default`, rename of shared pipelines, `PipelineServiceDefinitions` CRUD). Existing `agent` users receive the change automatically on the next seed run (the seed does `destroy_all` and re-creates from the array).

### Security

- **EVO-1061 — Privilege escalation via delegation in `roles_controller`** — the role update endpoint allowed an `account_owner` to delegate permissions they did not themselves hold (proxy privilege escalation path). Closed with an explicit check: a user can only delegate permissions they themselves possess. Includes a regression spec.
- **EVO-1061 — Review blockers H1/M1-M3** — high/medium findings from round 2 of the code review applied (account scope, payload validation, error responses without leakage).
- **2FA backup codes** — codes are now hashed with BCrypt before storage; previously they sat in plaintext in the database (any DB read exposed the user's second factor).

## [v1.0.0-rc2] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **New `super_admin` role** — installation-level operator. Holds all `account_owner` permissions plus `installation_configs.manage` (the only permission that grants access to the `/settings/admin` panel: SMTP, Storage, Social Login, OpenAI, Channels, Inbound Email, Frontend Runtime). Automatically assigned to the user created via the setup wizard (bootstrap). Other users created later via the UI continue to receive `account_owner` (no access to the admin panel).
  - Implementation split between `db/seeds/rbac.rb` (fresh installs) and migration `20260505155854_promote_first_user_to_super_admin.rb` (existing PROD — the only way to get there automatically, since `db:seed` does not run on deploys).
  - The migration creates the role, syncs permissions via `ResourceActionsConfig.all_permission_keys`, **revokes `installation_configs.manage` from `account_owner`**, promotes the first user (`User.order(:created_at).first`) and **revokes active tokens** for that user to force re-login (otherwise the old JWT with `role: account_owner` would remain valid until expiry).
  - `SetupBootstrapService#assign_global_role` updated to assign `super_admin` (with a defensive fallback to `account_owner`).
  - Idempotent and reversible (`down` restores the previous state).
### Fixed

- **POST `/api/v1/users` returned 500 when the payload omitted `role`**: now falls back to the `agent` default instead of looking up `Role.find_by!(key: nil)` and raising `RecordNotFound`. (#9)
- **`RoleSerializer` did not expose `key` / `system`**: the frontend depends on these keys for the role select to work; added to `full` and `basic`. (#9)
- **Login always returned 401 for users created via the UI**: `UsersController#create` permitted `:password` in `new_user_params` but did not pass the value to `AgentBuilder.new(...)`. Since `AgentBuilder` falls back to `password.presence || "1!aA#{SecureRandom.alphanumeric(12)}"` when `password` is `nil`, every agent created via the UI was born with a random Argon2 hash that nobody knew — login with the typed password never matched. Now `password: new_user_params['password']` is forwarded. `bulk_create` left unchanged (intentionally generates a random password — invite flow).
- **Migration `20260423162525_add_message_template_permissions_to_account_owner` failed on fresh install with `PG::UndefinedTable: roles`**: the `init_schema` migration (timestamp `9025...` due to a historical typo) creates the `roles` table, but runs AFTER this one because of the future timestamp. Added `ActiveRecord::Base.connection.table_exists?(:roles)` guard on `up` and `down` — fresh installs skip the migration silently (the seed/bootstrap covers it later), existing installations keep running as before.
- **`init_schema` (timestamp `9025...`) fully idempotent**: `make setup` on fresh install raced against the `evo-bot-runtime` Go core, which tries to create a minimal `users` table at startup. When the Go service won the race, `init_schema` failed with `PG::DuplicateTable`. Migration rewritten with `if_not_exists: true` on every `create_table`, `add_index`, and an `add_fk_if_missing` helper for foreign keys — the final result is now deterministic regardless of who arrives first. (commit `ec736a9`)
- **EVO-1002 follow-up**: registered the `update_message_template` and `delete_message_template` permissions in the RBAC seeder. (#5)
- **EVO-971**: the `/setup/status` gate now considers both bootstrap and licensing — not only licensing. (#8)
- **EVO-967**: invited agents are auto-confirmed; role lookup now tolerates a missing role without returning 500. (#3)

### Changed

- CI workflow also publishes `develop` images to staging. (#4)
- `installation_configs.manage` moved from the `account_owner` default permission list to the `account_owner_exclusive` list in `db/seeds/rbac.rb`. **Controlled breaking change**: account_owners created after this release no longer see the "Admin Settings" menu (expected behavior in single-tenant Community — only the bootstrap user / `super_admin` should have access). The upgrade migration preserves access for the original operator.
