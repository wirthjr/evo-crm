# Public extension contract of evo-auth-service-community. See
# EXTENSION_POINTS.md at the repository root for the full contract.
# The three sub-modules under this namespace ship no-op or
# Devise-delegating defaults; an external consumer overrides a specific
# extension point at process start via
# EvoExtensionPoints.replace(:key) { |...| ... }.
#
# Sub-modules are autoloaded by Zeitwerk under lib/evo_extension_points/.
