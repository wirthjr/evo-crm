# Skills Overview

Skills teach Claude new capabilities through markdown instructions. They are not plugins or code — they are structured prompts that Claude follows when a skill is triggered.

## What Is a Skill?

A skill is a directory in `.claude/skills/` containing a `SKILL.md` file with:

- **Frontmatter** (`name`, `description`) that controls when the skill triggers
- **Instructions** that tell Claude exactly what to do, step by step

```
.claude/skills/
  fin-daily-pulse/
    SKILL.md          # The skill definition
  social-post-writer/
    SKILL.md
  int-stripe/
    SKILL.md
```

## Skill Categories

Skills are organized by prefix:

The repo ships **175+ skills** total: **~150 business skills** + **25 engineering skills (`dev-*`)**.

## How Triggering Works

The `description` field in SKILL.md frontmatter tells Claude when to activate the skill. Claude matches user intent against all skill descriptions and picks the best match.

Example from `fin-daily-pulse`:

```yaml
---
name: fin-daily-pulse
description: "Daily financial pulse -- queries Stripe (MRR, charges, churn, failures) and Omie (accounts payable/receivable, invoices) to generate an HTML snapshot of the company's financial health. Trigger when user says 'financial pulse', 'financial snapshot', or 'financial metrics'."
---
```

Key tips for good descriptions:
- State what the skill does concretely
- List trigger phrases the user might say
- Be specific enough to avoid overlapping with other skills

## SKILL.md Structure

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: "What it does and when to trigger it."
---

# Skill Title

## Step 1 -- Gather Data

## Step 2 -- Process

## Step 3 -- Generate Output

```

## Creating a New Skill

### 1. Create the directory and file

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-new-skill
```

### 2. Write SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: my-new-skill
description: "Generate a weekly team standup summary from Linear issues and GitHub PRs. Trigger when user says 'standup summary', 'team update', or 'what did the team do'."
---

# Team Standup Summary

Generates a weekly summary of team activity.

## Step 1 -- Collect Linear Data

Use the `/int-linear-review` skill to fetch:
- Issues completed this week
- Issues in progress
- Blockers

## Step 2 -- Collect GitHub Data

Use the `/int-github-review` skill to fetch:
- PRs merged this week
- PRs in review

## Step 3 -- Generate Summary

Format as a markdown report with sections:
- Completed
- In Progress
- Blocked
- Highlights

## Step 4 -- Save

Save to `workspace/projects/reports/[C] YYYY-MM-DD-standup.md`
```

### 3. Test it

Open Claude Code and say: "generate a standup summary" -- Claude should match your skill's description and follow the instructions.

## Skills vs Agents

| | Agent | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | Persona with identity and memory | Step-by-step instructions |
| **Scope** | Broad domain (finance, community) | Specific task (daily pulse, post writer) |
| **Memory** | Persistent across sessions | None (stateless) |
| **Invoked by** | Slash command or auto-routing | Description matching or agent delegation |

Skills are often used *by* agents. For example, the Flux agent uses `fin-daily-pulse`, `fin-weekly-report`, and `int-stripe` skills to do its work. Routines invoke skills through agents via the runner.
