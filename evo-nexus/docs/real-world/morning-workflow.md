# A Morning with EvoNexus

What does it actually look like to start your day with EvoNexus running? Here's a walkthrough of a typical morning, from waking up to being fully productive.

## 7:00 AM — "Good morning"

You open Claude Code in your terminal and type two words: "good morning."

Clawdia, the operations agent, takes over. Behind the scenes, the scheduler has already run the Todoist review at 6:50 AM, so task data is fresh. Now Clawdia pulls together:

- **Calendar** — today's meetings, prep notes for the first one
- **Email** — unread count, anything flagged as urgent overnight
- **Tasks** — top priorities for today, anything overdue
- **Yesterday's log** — what you said you'd do, what actually happened

The output is a structured morning briefing. Not a wall of text — a prioritized list of what matters today.

**Example output:**

> 3 meetings today (first at 10:00 — grooming with Danilo, prep: review EVO-589).
> 7 unread emails — 2 urgent (Stripe webhook failure alert, partner contract from Thais).
> Top tasks: review PR #412, respond to HostGator proposal, prep Summit timeline.
> Yesterday: completed 4/6 planned tasks. Carried over: LinkedIn post draft, Academy outline.

## 7:15 AM — Email Triage

The email triage routine kicks in automatically (or you trigger it with `make triage`). Clawdia reads your Gmail inbox and classifies each message:

- **Urgent / Action needed** — flagged with suggested response
- **FYI / Low priority** — summarized in one line
- **Spam / Marketing** — noted for archive

For urgent emails, Clawdia drafts a reply. You review it, adjust if needed, and confirm with "YES, SEND" — or save it as a draft to refine later.

The triage doesn't just list emails. It connects them to context: "This email from Samara references the invoice you discussed in yesterday's Fathom meeting." That's persistent memory at work.

## 7:30 AM — Meeting Sync

Every 30 minutes throughout the day, the meeting sync routine checks Fathom for new recordings. If you had calls yesterday evening or early this morning, the transcripts are already processed.

For each meeting, you get:
- A concise summary (not the full transcript)
- Action items extracted and attributed to people
- Tasks created in Todoist with proper priority and category
- Meeting notes saved to the workspace

No more watching recordings to remember what was decided. No more "I think we agreed to..." in follow-up emails.

## 8:00 AM — Project Check

You ask: "What's the status on our sprint?" Atlas, the projects agent, checks Linear and GitHub:

- **Linear** — current sprint progress, issues in review, blockers, who's assigned to what
- **GitHub** — open PRs waiting for review, community issues that need triage, CI status

Atlas knows your team. When it says "Guilherme has 3 PRs waiting for review," it's pulling from the people memory, not just API data. It knows Guilherme is backend, so those PRs are likely Evolution API core changes.

## 8:30 AM — Ready to Work

In under 90 minutes, without opening a single dashboard or scrolling through any inbox manually, you know:

1. What's on your calendar and what to prep
2. Which emails need replies (and have drafts ready)
3. What happened in yesterday's meetings and what follow-ups are pending
4. Where your sprint stands and what's blocked
5. Your prioritized task list for the day

You pick the first task and start working. When someone asks about a community issue at 2 PM, Pulse has the context. When finance questions come up at 4 PM, Flux has today's numbers. When you wrap up at 9 PM, the end-of-day routine logs everything automatically.

## What Makes This Different

This isn't "asking AI for help." The routines ran before you even opened your laptop. The memory persisted from yesterday. The agents already know your team, your projects, your preferences.

You didn't configure a workflow. You said "good morning" and got a briefing that accounts for your calendar, your email, your tasks, your meetings, and your priorities — cross-referenced against persistent memory about your company, your team, and your projects.

That's the difference between a chatbot and an operating layer.
