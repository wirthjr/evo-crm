module EvoFlow
  # Pure Sidekiq worker (repo convention: include Sidekiq::Worker, lives in
  # app/workers/). retry: 5 overrides the global sidekiq.yml max_retries: 3.
  #
  # On retry exhaustion the sidekiq_retries_exhausted hook fires and the job
  # lands in the (default-on) Dead Set, broadcasting Wisper
  # :evo_flow_publish_failed for downstream handling (listener wired later).
  # Honest caveat: this hook runs in-process on the final attempt; if that
  # process is hard-killed (OOM/SIGKILL) the hook does not run — terminal
  # alerting then relies on Dead Set monitoring, not this broadcast.
  #
  # Signature is perform(path, payload) — Client#post needs the target path;
  # documented divergence from EVO-1238's perform(payload).
  #
  # Exceptions to F4: EvoFlow::InvalidEventName and EvoFlow::ConfigurationError
  # are NOT retried — both are code/config bugs, not transient failures
  # (rescued earliest in #perform, logged + dropped). Configuration won't fix
  # itself on retry; retrying just floods the Dead Set with the same env-var
  # error and triggers spurious :evo_flow_publish_failed broadcasts.
  # Drops still emit Wisper :evo_flow_publish_dropped (data[:reason]) so that
  # alerts can fire on "integration silently parked" — distinct from the
  # transient :evo_flow_publish_failed channel that listeners may treat as
  # retry/escalation noise.
