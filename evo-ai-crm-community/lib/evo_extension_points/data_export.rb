module EvoExtensionPoints
  # Data export extension point. The community release does not declare any
  # exportable tables on its own — DataExport.exportable_tables_for_scope
  # returns []. An external consumer registers exportable tables via
  # DataExport.register(name:, &scope_block) at boot, and the registry is
  # consulted at runtime.
  #
  # The "scope block" receives a scope_id (an opaque consumer-defined value)
  # and must return an Enumerable of records or a query-like object the caller
  # can iterate. The community never reaches into community tables on behalf
  # of the consumer; the block is the consumer's responsibility.
