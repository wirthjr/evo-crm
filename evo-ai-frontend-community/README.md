## About

**Arco CRM Frontend** is the web interface of the Arco CRM Community — a modern React application providing the full user experience for conversations, contacts, agents, channels, automations, reports, and settings.

Built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS 4 and an in-house design system, it delivers a fast, accessible, dark-mode-first experience aligned with the Arco CRM visual identity.

## Part of the Arco CRM Community

Arco CRM Frontend is part of the [Arco CRM Community](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community) ecosystem maintained by Evolution Foundation. To use the full stack, clone the umbrella repository with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community.git
```

The Community Edition is **single-tenant** by design — one account, no multi-tenancy overhead, no super-admin, no billing or plans. All limits are removed and features are unlocked by default.
